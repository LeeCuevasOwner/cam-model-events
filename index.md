## Tips for a Smooth and Successful Show

1. **Pre-Stream Announcement:** Post teasers on Instagram, Twitter, and Telegram a few days in advance, building hype for the event. Post sneak peeks of the decorations, balloons, or your outfit.
2. **Engage with Viewers:** Encourage fans to buy balloons by interacting with them and hyping up the next balloon pop. Keep the energy playful and flirty to get them excited.
3. **Surprise Reveal:** Make the reveal of each balloon fun and seductive—building anticipation before popping the balloon adds extra excitement.
4. **Goal Reminders:** Regularly remind viewers how many balloons are left and encourage more participation. You can even offer an extra surprise for the fan who buys the last balloon.
5. **Top Tipper Prizes:** Consider offering a small bonus for the top tipper of the night, such as a personalized thank-you video or a shout-out during the stream.
6. **Post-Stream Follow-Up:** After the stream, post a thank-you message on your social media platforms, acknowledging your fans and reminding them to come back next Saturday for more surprises.
